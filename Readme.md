💫 About Me

🔍 I am a Computer Science & Engineering (AI & ML) graduate currently working as a Content Developer at the Directorate of Information Technology, Government of Tripura, contributing to the development and management of dynamic e-governance web platforms.

🏗 My work goes beyond traditional content management. I design and maintain a full-stack Content Management System (CMS) built using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, enabling administrators to manage government portals efficiently without modifying code directly.

🌱 I continuously build expertise in system design, scalable backend architecture, and AI-driven applications. I focus on creating modular, secure, and maintainable systems aligned with real-world administrative workflows.

🚀 Passionate about platform-level development within the JavaScript ecosystem and building intelligent systems that create meaningful public impact.
