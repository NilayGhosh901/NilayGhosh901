# 💫 About Me

🔍 I'm a passionate Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML) graduate from Brainware University, with a Diploma in Electrical Engineering from Gomati District Polytechnic, Tripura. I blend my roots from Tripura with a modern tech-driven mindset—aiming to bridge the gap between innovation and accessibility.

🌱 Continuously building my expertise in machine learning, data science, and full-stack web development. Hands-on with Python, SQL, JavaScript, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and more. I've worked on practical AI/ML projects including disease prediction systems, AI chatbots, and voice assistants.

🚀 Currently growing my GitHub portfolio with practical AI/ML projects and seeking internship/mentorship opportunities. I'm actively looking to collaborate on meaningful tech projects or research in AI/ML, contributing to impactful, real-world open-source projects, and building accessible AI tools for education, healthcare, and local communities.
